You can find all processed data and checkpoints from this [Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ohqaw41v48c7e5p/AADb6_qWCwgHvsCqg121cK9Ma?dl=0).

For both Newsela-Manual and Wiki-Manual, we have prepared the processed gold paragraph alignment for train/dev/test sets and paragraph alignment generated by our algorithm for dev/test sets. 

The processed data for Wiki-Manual is in the above folder. Due to permission restriction, please contact us for the processed data used in Newsela-Manual experiment.
