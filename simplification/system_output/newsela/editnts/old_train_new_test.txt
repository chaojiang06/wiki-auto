winners are selected by the academy of sciences , which won the nobel prize committee .
dna is a material inside .

scientists used to believe that the dna inside human bodies are safe from harm .
it can be damaged very easily , and quickly .
dna , he could know what it could be , or .
otherwise dna of soon be destroyed .
other scientists began trying to figure out how the body manages to fix damaged dna .
sancar and modrich made the most important new discoveries as as american first first .
sancar discovered how the body repairs dna that has been damaged by different rays .

friction is part of lives in recent years .
sometimes it is helpful to the space experiments .
it is what makes a car stop when the driver steps to .
sometimes it is not helpful , but said .
it drags against a car 's tires like them out faster .
but scientists do not understand everything about why they happen , so scientists said .
it looks at the way atoms work in friction that it will try to hire an unusual thing in served in .
atoms are the building blocks of matter the .
an atom is the smallest possible part of the .
small that is special instruments like microscopes .
scientists measured how the placement of single atoms can hurt .

the friction generally increases with pressure , and that farmers can barely make that .
even things that look smooth , such as glass , have tiny bumps too small to see without help , but you need to get out .
after it left , the bumps on one surface drag on the bumps .
the heat means that the system loses force , or it , said sans , who works for the animal and the report .

then the motion between the surfaces slows , it can change a lot .

scientists slid a tiny metal point against a surface of crystals in the air .
the crystals separated into all pairs .
when the point slid over the pairs , they were back and forth .
the scientists found that '' the energy made by the rocking could be controlled by dragging the point '' in the same direction as the pairs .
the things that were learned from the study to treat .
for example , by understanding and controlling friction better , car parts and other machine parts could be made to last much longer than you are used .
friction is a critical part of everyday life , too .
it is the force makes the brakes in a car work when the driver steps on the .
sometimes it hinders us and do n't like a cake .
friction from the road drags against tires , wearing them out faster and sending us more often to the gas station to fuel up on .
most people take friction for a grant when we hit the .
a new study might help scientists understand more .

the researchers slid a tiny tip made of tungsten crystals that looks like it can be .
when the tip slid against the crystals .
the metal tip slid over the pairs , they climbed and forth .
the researchers found that a small was lower when the tip was off in which the atoms were arranged .

perhaps the eels were curling their bodies to live to strengthen .
eels have an organ inside their bodies like a electricity .

perhaps they can send out a much stronger shock , but it did then one end alone can .

it now seems that slugs do not not use photosynthesis .
