they want to encourage new and exciting places to reach students .
now , as co-director of gls , iaburn tries to develop games that make learning science a more active process .

but the streaks were not looking for signs .
ojha 's work shows that the liquid saltwater may help form the red saltwater on mars .
there is more work to do .

it would be a major leap to suggest that mars may have life on it , even called microbes .
but then it might be possible that parts of the planet are livable .
the study was done by scientists from last april .
the rover noted that mars had the ability for liquid water .
it is a vehicle that travels on the planet .
the pressure on mars has a sudden point of just a few degrees celsius .
the study noted the presence of perchlorates-a type of salt .

the scientists say that mars ' temperature would be right for liquid , perchlorate-filled water to form every day during winter and spring .
ojha 's work confirms that hydrated salts seem likely to have something to do with the wet-looking streaks on mars .
in the new study , scientists studied the find on the wrong way to look at the one another dinosaur .
the team found that perchlorates in abundance , and it seems like they have been getting hydrated .
ojha and his coworkers used the mars reconnaissance orbiter -lrb- mro -rrb- to check out the chemical in the wet-looking streaks .
it will study mars from up high up in the orbit .
they used a method called synod , which keeps track of what type of light an object is what makes to make conclusions about its composition .

microwave popcorn is a good snack .

they wanted to learn how to make popcorn .
virot and ponomare were interested in learning something different .
they wanted to know why popcorn acts and taste like it does .
the scientific name for popcorn is zea may everta .
popcorn kernels are rounder than other types of corn .
the layer covers the seed .
when the kernel gets very hot — above 212 degrees fahrenheit — the water inside turns to steam .
when the kernel gets very hot — above 212 degrees fahrenheit — the water inside turns to steam .
the steam moves into the kernel to an area called the endosperm .
but the hull can not take it all of the heat .
it turns into a spongy white flakes of popcorn .
the fluffy corn is double the size of the kernel .
viroto and pono cycling used high-tech cameras to watch the popping kernels .
they turned the heat up on a hot plate .

two scientists from france were fascinated by this process .
virot and ponomare are n't interested in improving the taste or experience of popcorn .
they wanted to know if popcorn causes act like the taste of popcorn .

the fluffy corn is twice as large as the original kernel .
viroto and pono cycling used high-speed cameras to capture this closely .

the researchers would usually like a snack , or popcorn .
most people do not understand how complicated popping kernels can be .
a pair of french scientists were fascinated by how the kernel develops a fluffy treat .
the popping of corn gives a powerful display of how the laws of physics apply to everything — even snack food .
until now , most research on popcorn has been focused on practical questions .
other scientists studied the shape of kernels .
they found that the ideal shape for an unpopped kernel is not different from an unpopped kernel .
other researchers have figured out how to cut the number of unpopped kernels in a batch of popcorn .

to observe this process very closely , virot and ponomine used their high-speed cameras to capture kernels popping on a hot plate .
they turned the heat up to 350 degrees celsius -lrb- 662 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
after hundreds of tries , they discovered that the popcorn gets kicked into the air .
when the leg is released , the popcorn moves like a gymnast doing some sort of back .
the scientists studying the dancers are from the ground .
they put kernels of microwave popcorn in an oven as they heat up the temperature 50 degrees .
ninety-six percent of the kernels popped when it reached 180 degrees celsius -lrb- livius -rrb- .

food chemists determined that the ideal moisture content of a kernel is 13.5 percent to 14 percent of its total weight .
food engineers say that the ideal shape for an unpopped kernel is not too large .

the scientists identified three possible possible possible reasons : the fracture of the hull , the rebound on the ground .

to figure out which was responsible , they placed a high-end microphone 30 centimeters away from the hot plate and audio with the high-speed camera .
there was no sound when the popcorn first opened .
a second fracture was observed 100 milliseconds later .
the scientists decided that the trigger for the popping sound was the release of water vapor .

the board also said it will make the rules tougher if they do n't see good improvements soon .
so far , marcus said the board has not seen enough " stepping up and ringing the alarm bells . "
he and other officials have made new plans .

most of the money will go to big projects that make it easier to clean with water or improve treatment plants .

catania began to notice something odd as he was studying electric premises .
many of them curled up their bodies when zapping a future meal .

perhaps not all of them are rulerless enough to do something to strengthen their electric power .
many parts of them have electricity inside their bodies .

some sacs sleep through the winter , or hibernate .
finally , it explains why all the slugs ended up as pale .
