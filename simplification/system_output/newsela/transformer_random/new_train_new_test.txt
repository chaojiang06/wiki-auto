besides earth , mars is now the only solar system in our solar system .
other planets have water in that are under the surface .

the rover found that the rover might have had water liquid water .
the machine can be explored by a robot that is underwater .
the water that found on mars was very quickly .
a type of salt was used to last for a type of salt in size .
these salts keep the water from evaporating into a gas .
this water may be forming wet streaks .

the saltss seem to disappear in areas where the streaks were not looking anymore .
o 's work shows that the saltwater may help form the wet streaks form .
however , there is more work to do that in water .
eventually , the hope is that a rover can take a closer look at the streaks .
if humans ever go to mars , they could use the perch .

friction is part of our everyday lives .
sometimes it is even more helpful .
it 's what makes a car stop when the driver steps on the brakes .
sometimes it is not .
it drags a car 's tires , wearing them faster .
yet , scientists do not understand why they happen .
it looks at the way the friction work in friction .
elements are made of atoms .
it is not known what to do to the atom .
they can not be seen without the help of their large , special instruments like microscopes .
scientists measured how the placement of single bodies affects the strength of the friction between two materials .

when the point slid over the pairs , they rocked and forth .
the scientists found that the energy made by rocking the use of same pairs could be used by a similar change in the direction .
the study 's authors might help scientists understand enough information about the problem .
for example , by understanding and friction , better parts and other parts could be made last much longer .
friction is a critical of everyday life .
it is the force that makes the brakes in a car .
sometimes we take the video .
it often sent us more gas to the station .
most people take friction for when we hit the pedal .

thousands of brazilian babies have gone through the same heads .
there is no known cure for their condition .
in 2015 , brazil reported nearly 3,000 microce cases of microphace .
no one knows exactly why .
they believe the disease may be caused by mosquitoes .

zika zika is a zikaika zimaika .
it is very , but it 's a virus that is a living thing .
they can change over time .
mutations can not make it easier for certain mutations to travel from one person to another .
the fact that zika has quickly suggests mutated it has become very quickly .
scientists are trying to figure out how it has changed .
scott weaver is a scientist who works on mosquitoes .
he believes the virus has mutate the past few years .
he thinks there could be a lot more ebola than in the future .

some people believe zika 's mutation can spread the way to more quickly .
it would increase the chances of a virus that would increase the virus .
the mosquito would then pass the disease to another person by pulling them .

to try to prove that , scientists will look for signs of umbilical in blood-cord-umika , a link to the zless cord .
the umbilical cord connects the mother and child , or fetus .

scientists will be looking for antibodies in the blood .
human bodies produce antibodies .
the antibodies try to kill the genes .
each type is different .
they are designed to fight a disease .

what is more closely related to zika zika zika has the ability to reproduce themselves once they are able to reach themselves .

for that reason , it is hard to tell if a woman has come down with one of those kinds of diseases .

the new discovery of the fetus was infected with zika and that it happened recently .
however , weaver says it 's hard to get a very good chance .
the new information could help scientists develop a vaccine for zika .

even without that information , there is already some indication-zikace-zphaly connection .
there have also been reports of genetic material from zika zika zircon .
some of the women who went to birth could also have a baby orca can not be found .
this information is not yet airtight .

the researchers concluded that the trigger trigger for the sound of water was popping up like the vapor .

it turns into a spakey white popcorn .
after this popping is over , the corn is fluffy twice as large .
to observe this process , the very closely , virot and pono used their high-speed cameras to capture a popping plate on a hot plate .
they turned up to 350 degrees celsius -lrb- 662 -rrb- degrees fahrenheit-and placed a few kernels on the surface .

now most research on popcorn has been focused on practical questions .
food engineers say that the best shape of an unpopped is a kernel .
these include high-heeled kernels by 75 percent since the 1950s .
virot and pononko are n't interested in improving in popcorn .

when all is done , the kernel is twice as large as eight times dense .
to observe this detail , virot and pono trained the high-speed camera on a hot plate .
they started looking for 350 degrees .
the scientists discovered that the whole thing gets a few millimeters to a few millimeters a few feet into the air .

the board also said that it will make the rules tougher if they do n't see improvements soon .
so far , marcus said , the board has n't seen enough " stepping up enough and bells to reach the bells . "

perhaps perhaps those regions were so that they can be able to strengthen their bodies as their power to make electric power .
