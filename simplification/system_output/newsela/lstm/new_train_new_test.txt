ojha 's work shows the liquid saltwater in mars .
still , there is more work to do to prove that it is really there .

however , there is more work to do to prove the presence of liquid water itself .

this would be a big deal to suggest that mars may have life on it .
but it makes it possible that parts of the planet are livable .
the study builds on research from last april .
scientists using the rover from the curiosity rover noted that the planet had the answer of the ice .

ojha 's work confirms that hydrated salts that hydrated salts seem — that hydrated on on mars .
in the new study , scientists took the search for one step further .
they found perchlorates in numbers , and it seems like they have been getting hydrated .
ojha and his fellow researchers used the mars reconnaissance orbiter -lrb- mro -rrb- to check out the chemical composition of the wet - looking streaks .

a study published monday in the journal nature shows that this might be .
they spent several weeks practicing .
in the study , their brains were found at the university of california at santa barbara .
then the scientists looked at the process of how certain parts of the brain were called modules .
the task of the task was to make students have to play them with your fingers .

in the early practice , the motor module and the visual module remained in all subjects .

those parts of the brain can help figure out how to track ways of thinking that the brain can use .

thousands of brazilian babies born last year have larger heads .

no one is sure exactly what is causing the problem .

until 2007 , only a few cases of people infected with ebola .
the deadly disease is caused by the zika virus .
it is a living thing .
scientists know a virus like zika 's blood .
this could allow it to travel more easily from one person to another .
zika is just stopping the fact that zika has had cancer .
scientists are trying to figure out how it has changed .
scott weaver is an expert on diseases that spread by mosquitoes .
he believes the disease has had problems over the past few years .
he thinks there is some change in the process .

such a mutation would allow zika to spread more quickly .

in the case , human bacteria makes cells from the air .
the cells try to kill the viruses .

then , scientists knew something else : they know very little about the new book .
in fact , until 2007 there were only occasional cases of people infected with the virus .
now , the zika virus is getting into a huge land .
in may 2015 , brazil reported its first case of zika .
they even showed up on the island of puerto rico .

however , weaver says it is very important to get dengue .
if the new cord blood information was valuable , perhaps that will spur scientists to develop a vaccine for zika .

it 's also good more to make the robotic increase .
weaver 's team at u.t.m.b. is studying the virus now in the hopes of the virus .

for that , still other researchers are part of a larger team attempting to shore .

the popping of corn presents a powerful display of how the laws of physics apply to everything — even snack food .
until now , most research on the box has been focused on questions about how to look at the students .
other scientists studied the shape of kernels .
they are an eye - looking eye for person@1 .
other plant researchers have figured out how to reduce the number of unpopped kernels in the ordinal@1  of popcorn .
ponomarenko does n't interested in doing the taste or the taste or experience of popcorn .
instead , they wanted to understand the physical origins of some of the most famous traits about the food , like what makes it jump and where that pop - pop sounds from .

ponomarenko used their high - speed cameras to capture kernels popping on a hot plate .
the cardinal@1 were given a few few on a scorching surface .
after hundreds of tries , they discovered that the popcorn gets kicked into the air by a " leg " that emerges from the broken hull .
when the leg is released , the popcorn move as a gymnast .
the team checked the important temperature that the team needs to get to the other people .

scientist kenneth catania made the discovery .
catania began to notice something odd as he was studying electric eels .
many of them curled up their bodies when zapping a future meal .
the scientists brought their head to their tail with the fish in between .
catania noticed that younger , smaller eels curled up frequently during their electric attacks .
young eels have a little bad power .

older people do n't know much about it .

such prey take extra power to knock out .
catania thought he knew why he saw might be happening .
the eels were curling their bodies so the bodies are stronger .
in the future , they have a brain inside .
the two ends might be able to work together .
maybe they can send out a much stronger shock .
catania decided to design an experiment to test his idea .
he took a fish and put it near an acre .
the fish had wires attached to the fish .

they thought the animals were feeding themselves through the ground .
a new study is making scientists completely rethink the idea .
scientist sven gould used to run an experiment using six sacoglossans .
none of the people who were in the study were given any food at all for 55 days .
at the end of the 55 days , all the slugs were still alive .
they were all equally pale .
gould 's theory is that the slugs are just doing something so lots of animals do .
they are saving some of the food they can find .
they are then suddenly became sick .
the decision explains why all the slugs ended up just falling .
once their bodies had used the stored green turtles , they stopped being bright green .
it now seems that slugs do not use photosynthesis to feed themselves .
yet there is another reason why there is another reason .
in some studies , they stop growing and die .

even if these slugs are not relying on photosynthesis for nutrition , they might be using some of the oxygen produced by the process .
