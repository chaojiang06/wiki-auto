in many parts of the world , humans are using groundwater faster than it can be replenished .
but the young groundwater is also more likely to be waste .

kalapana , hawaii — lava from the hawaiian volcano kilauea , destroyed many buildings in kalapana 25 years ago .
aku hauanio 's father 's house was one of them .
the hard lava is called " pahoehoe .
hauanio said that before the volcano erupted , the beach was one of the most beautiful places on the island .
" so so it 's hard to explain , he says .
in 1991 , he watched the giant fire and destroy the house where he was born and raised .
his father owned the home when the lava flowed slowly to the coast .
the lava flow entered the house through the back .
the org@1 reported , " burning homes and many are in the land .
a generation later and 12 miles up the road lies pahoa , the latest target of the lava from kilauea .

they begged him to move the house to a safer area .
months earlier , church members moved a nearby church .
he hired a trailer with a trailer .
a week after his home burned , he rolled his current house 2 miles up the road .
lava said , " flows like water , but it 's not .
there are two main kinds of lava .
the pahoehoe that covers the beach here could be shown in a natural history museum .
there are many types of types , wrinkled , billowy , wrinkled , sticky , sticky , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy , sticky , glassy
today , kapalana is lovely in its own way , hauaino said .
the home is one of the few active volcanoes in the world .
a red trail of cinders from the heart of this small area comes from a plain of billowing , rock - hard pahoehoe lava to the ocean .
hauanio remembers his green , previous - volcano beach town on the east end of the island of hawaii .
so beautiful it 's hard to explain .
he watched it in 1991 as it slowly gobbled up the house where he was born and raised .
his father still lived there when the lava made its way to the coast .
he remembers watching at 2 o ' clock in the meadow .
the u.s. geological survey -lrb- usgs -rrb- reported the eruption of kilauea and the lava 's fierce deep homes in kalapana .

the change is meant in part to reduce the vetoes from parents craving more advanced tastes .
the point , tom leverton said , is to recognize that while children drive the desire to visit , it 's the parents who hold the car keys .
it offers " all - new menu items for grown - up tastes .
the company is mulling replacing those jingling of a plastic " play pass , " a la dave and  .
parental have been polite , said leverton .
in this week , several parents said they like the chain 's pizza as it is , especially the pepperoni , which seemed to match .
bohmer is a mom of four and said she has at least two birthday parties at chuck e. cheese 's .
she and the kids are partial to pepperoni .
she and the kids are partial to pepperoni .
nearby , zab herrera , 38 , also handed out slices of his daughters .
it 's easier to just get one pizza that the whole family likes .
the new building will have an expanded test kitchen , leverton said .
leverton , who works for the gpe@1 , is now a norp@1 .
the menu was a great opportunity to really do that .
it is easy , snack snack .
two scientists from france wanted to learn more about it .
emmanuel virot and alexandre ponomarenko studied the snack fish very closely .

they wanted to learn how to make better popcorn .
ponomarenko and ponomarenko were interested in learning something different .
they wanted to figure out why milk acts .
it is the new name for popcorn is zea mays .
kernels are than other types of corn .
there is a thin layer that covers the seed .
the kernel gets very hot — above quantity@2 of water inside the planet .

the moves moves into the place to see an area called the endosperm .
eventually , the ship can be the heat .
it turns into a spongy white flake of popcorn .
after it finally pops , the fluffy corn is double the size of the kernel .
virot and ponomarenko used high - tech cameras to watch the popping kernels .
they turned the heat up on a hot plate .

after they were done testing the kernels at the end of the day , the team would sometimes celebrate by eating the popcorn together .
two scientists were fascinated by this process .
ponomarenko and ponomarenko are n't interested in improving the taste or experience of popcorn .
instead , they wanted to know more about what causes milk to act .

the pups can be twice as large as the original kernel .
ponomarenko used high - speed cameras to capture this process very closely .
the cameras took thousands of pictures every second .
they placed a few kernels on the very hot surface .

most people do not understand how complicated popping kernels can be .
a pair of french science researchers were fascinated by how the kernel transforms into a fluffy treat .
the popping of corn presents a powerful display of how the laws of physics should be useful .
until now , most research on popcorn has been focused on questions .
other scientists studied the shape of kernels .
they found that the best shape for an unpopped kernel .
other plant researchers have figured out how to reduce the number of unpopped kernels in a batch of popcorn .
ponomarenko and ponomarenko are n't interested in improving the taste or experience of popcorn .
they wanted to understand how the food made it sort of the food , like what makes it jump and where that pop - pop sound comes from .

the fluffy corn is twice as large and eight times less dense than the original kernel .
to figure this process very closely , virot and ponomarenko used their high - speed cameras to record kernels popping .
they placed a few kernels on the scorching surface .
after the ship 's ship , they discovered that the popcorn gets kicked into the air by a " leg " .
when the leg is released , the ice moves like a gymnast .
then the french team decided the critical temperature that popcorn needs to pop .
they put up the temperature 50 degrees at a time .
ninety - six percent of the kernels popped when it reached 180 degrees celsius -lrb- 356 degrees .

until now , most research on popcorn has been focused on questions .
scientists determined that the optimum moisture happy of a kernel is 13.5 percent to 14 percent of its total weight .
food scientists confirmed that the best shape for an unpopped kernel .
they have reduced the amount of unpopped by 75 percent since the 1950s .
ponomarenko and ponomarenko are n't interested in improving popcorn .
they simply wanted to understand the physical discovery of some of its most colors , like the forces that make kernels jump and the source of the produced pop - pop sound .

scientist kenneth catania said that scientists made the new discovery .
catania began to notice something odd as he was studying electric eels .
many of them curled up their bodies when they arrived in the park .
they brought their head to their tail with the fish in between .
catania noticed that younger , smaller eels curled up frequently during their electric attacks .
the national size of the crowd is much less shock .
the national size of the crowd is much less shock .
but older eels almost never bothered to curl up .
the only time they were attacking a very large fish .
such prey take extra power to knock out .
catania thought he saw why the curling he saw might be happening .
perhaps the eels were the bodies of their bodies so to strengthen their power .
eels have an surgery inside their bodies .
the two ends might be able to work together .
maybe they can send out a much stronger shock .
catania decided to design an experiment to test his idea .
he put it near an eel as bait .
the fish had arms attached to it .

they send out a jolt of electricity that forces hidden fish to move and thus show their location .
the discovery was made by conservationist kenneth catania .

a lot of fruits and vegetables sold in the united states are grown in mexico .
big u.s. companies like wal - mart buy plenty of fruits and vegetables from large mexican farms .
